collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-09-bbackprop2019
excerpt: 'Embed blackbox combinatorial solvers into neural networks without any sacrifices! How to turn c++ code for solving e.g. travelling salesman into a differentiable NN building block. Mostly theoretical work with update rule resembling classical SVM-based methods but revamped to make good theoretical sense for deep learning.'
