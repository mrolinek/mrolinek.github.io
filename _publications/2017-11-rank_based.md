excerpt: 'Direct optimization of rank-based metrics can be done via structured SVM framework. But then there is a nasty algorithmical subproblem to deal with. We dealt with it in optimal runtime.'

*Remark from the future:*
The whole structured SVM approach has visible limitations for this problem. Compared to [#blackboxbackprop](/publication/2019-09-bbackprop2019) it looks very unnatural. Take a look at [newer paper](/publication/2019-11-ranking2019) to see how the same problem can be tackled more elegantly
