**News**
* Moved to London to work as a researcher at a trading firm [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.co.uk)
* Invited talk at the NeurIPS workshop on [Learning Meets Combinatorial Algorithms](https://sites.google.com/view/lmca2020/home)
* Invited talk at [INFORMS 2020](https://www.informs.org/Meetings-Conferences)!
* A fresh RL paper [Sample-efficient Cross-Entropy Method for Real-time Planning](publication/2020-08-20-CEM2020)!  
* Our paper [Optimizing Rank-based Metrics with Blackbox Differentiation](publication/2019-11-ranking2019) was among the ~25 nominees for the best paper award at CVPR2020 (out of ~1400 papers). Yay! 

**Who am I?** Machine-learning researcher, Python geek, math olympiad enthusiast, occasionally problem-solving teacher in Africa, mountain lover, amateur Waltz dancer   

**My research mission:**
* Black magic for extracting signal from financial markets :).
* Use combinatorial algorithms to improve deep learning.
* Use deep learning to improve combinatorial algorithms. 
* With the above two, compete on computer vision benchmarks.

**Other research topics:** keypoint matching, metric learning, constraint satisfaction, reinforcement learning, generative models, disentanglement, stochastic optimization, graph neural networks, operations research
