2020-03-20	Deep Graph Matching via Blackbox Differentiation of Combinatorial Solvers	Arxiv	Using our earlier work, we wrap a SOTA graph matching solver into a neural network building block. With additional help of a few architectural trick, we obtain SOTA on deep graph matching benchmarks.	2020-03-GraphMatching	http://mrolinek.github.io/files/gm2020.pdf
